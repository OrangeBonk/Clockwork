I have removed the files from this repository due to receiving a DMCA from Conna Wiles.

After discovering that an employee of Conna Wiles had been stealing private code from a private and hidden repository, adding it to the public Clockwork repository without any credit; I decided to release all of the changes I had made for LemonPunch since January 07 2014. 

The release is standalone, meaning it doesn't use CloudAuth; This is because CloudAuth sends a lot of information to authx.cloudsixteen.com including information about your players and also allows anyone with access to CloudAuth to browse any file within whatever you are using to host Clockwork.

GitHub Staff,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The following repositories violate copyright on intellectual property
that I own, namely Clockwork and Schemas:

The copyrighted work at issue is the ('gamemode', 'schema') 'Clockwork'
created by Cloud Sixteen ( Copyright Certificate:
http://cloudsixteen.com/copyright.pdf ) ( http://CloudSixteen.com )

The repositories where our copyrighted material is hosted (and contains
method to illegally bypass 'crack' the software) at the following locations:

All files in the repositories that contain the header below are infringing:

CloudSixteen.com do not share, re-distribute or modify
without permission of its author (kurozael@gmail.com).

The purpose of this fork, from our original repository at
http://github.com/CloudSixteen/Clockwork, is to bypass digital rights
management systems in place to prevent the loading and use of the
software without a license.

We would like the repositories shut down completely, or all files
containing that header removed and not to be re-uploaded in any form
without the express permission of Cloud Sixteen.

(These repositories are in addition to those in our previous notice to you.)
